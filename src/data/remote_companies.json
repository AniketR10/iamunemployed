Most of us work from our home offices, but some of us prefer to rent office space or work at a coworking facility. We do our best to accommodate the unique schedule and work-style requirements of our people, but because our work is highly collaborative within project teams, it’s important that everyone have a reasonable amount of overlap with traditional middle-of-the-day business hours. This means that we’re not a suitable option for anyone looking to pick up a handful of night & weekend moonlighting hours. We’re only considering developers who are able to regularly work 30 or more billable hours per week.\n\nBeing a distributed company is built into Art & Logic’s DNA — since being founded in 1991, we’ve acquired, built, and stumbled across tools and practices that let us work efficiently and productively, even though no two of us are in the same location.\nFor most of our collaboration, we rely on the suite of tools provided as part of Google Apps for Business — we use Docs for shared documents, Groups for project-specific communications (both within the team and between Art & Logic and clients), and Hangouts/GChat for real-time voice/video communication.\n\nFrom reading the trade magazines, you’d think that there wasn’t any development talent once you got 50 miles outside of the Bay Area, except for a few small pockets of talent in New York City and Boston. That’s a pretty dumb idea. We also disagree with the idea that work is mostly a place you go — it’s a thing you do, and given the right environment, support, and culture, you should be able to do great work from wherever you work best. For most of us at Art & Logic, that workspace is at home, where we can maintain control of noise, distractions, and other factors that can make it difficult to remain productive throughout the work day.\n\nWe like to say that we don’t telecommute, because there’s no place for us to telecommute to. If you’ve had bad experiences working remotely in the past because you’ve been left out of what was happening in ‘the office’ — we’re different. The tools, infrastructure, and work practices that we’ve adopted over the years let us work together effectively, efficiently, and very collaboratively without regard to the physical distances between any two of us.",

We work hard to live our core values of Inclusion, Autonomy, and Mastery:\n\n- We have an internally open pay system tied to a detailed career ladder to promote transparency around pay and engineering levels, and keep the company accountable for equal pay for equal work.\n- We trust our employees to do the jobs we hired them to do. Each team is responsible for making their own decisions and coming up with the appropriate solutions for their particular project.\n- We provide a bottomless continuing education stipend and internal trainings to help our employees skill up.",

We provide a travel stipend to encourage visits to our physical offices, but it's not required. We have an annual \"Formidagathering\" where everyone gets together for a week in Seattle to learn, play, socialize, and work together.\n\nThough we hire entry-level engineers in our physical locations, we recognize that folks early in their career need more hands-on mentorship, something that's harder to provide to remote employees. That's why we require that our remote engineers have 2-3 years of professional experience.",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that’s a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.\n\nBecause we’re more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs build a business ―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases, results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.\n\nSee how our clients [talk](http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/) about [our approach](http://headway.io/compass/) and check out some of the [recognition we’ve received](http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/) so far.

However, traditional tools like databases, spreadsheets, and dashboards have been ill-equipped to manage such content.

    "company_technologies": "Java : Java is one of the most commonly used languages for developing against the QuickBooks platform. With tons of open source libraries/frameworks and huge community support, it is no surprise that Java is one of the most of commonly used language. To help developers enable faster integration with QuickBooks Online, Intuit officially provides a Java SDK with a set of class libraries that make it easier to call QuickBooks APIs, providing access to QuickBooks data.\n\nC Sharp (C#) : Along with Java, C# is one of most prominent used by Intuit developers. C# is a common language to build on the .NET platform primarily for Microsoft products. \n\nC# is completely backed by Microsoft and has huge community support. Just like for Java, Intuit provides a C# based .NET SDK to enable developers to more easily integrate with QuickBooks Online.\n\nPHP : PHP is one of the most widely used server-side scripting languages used for web development. There’s a ton of community supported PHP frameworks to enable easier/faster development. Given the wide usage of PHP in the industry, it’s no surprise that PHP is the third most commonly used language for developing on QuickBooks. Similar to Java and \nC#, there is an official PHP SDK for QBO integration.\n\nRuby : Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented programming language. Ruby is primarily used with the Rails platform (i.e., Ruby on Rails) for web development. Ruby on Rails has been around for a while with enough maturity and a thriving community.  Even though Intuit does not have an officially supported SDK for Ruby, there is an open source library available.\n\nPython : Python, similar to Ruby, is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language. Just like with PHP, there’s a ton of community-supported Python frameworks to enable easier/faster development, including a vibrant community. Even though Intuit does not provide an official integration SDK, Python is one of the top 5 languages used by developers integrating with the QuickBooks platform.\nOther : In addition to the above mentioned languages, we see developers using languages like C++, Perl, and ColdFusion (CFML) when integrating with the QuickBooks platform.",

We build our product with open source parts, work in the open, and release as much code as possible – [it's the right thing for people, technology, and business.](https://www.mapbox.com/about/open/)",

In many cases, this means modules, rather than applications. We distribute these modules for other developers to use on websites like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). For instance, [rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio) is a core part of our image processing pipeline that we make available for any Python programmer to use.\n\nA minority of our software is closed-source:\n\n* Software that connects server processes and is heavily dependent on our configuration. This is a prevalent category but tends to be very small, in terms of code.\n* Software that packages up business workflows. Software highly specific to Mapbox’s product, tied into our design, and core to our competitive advantage is often kept closed. These projects are usually applications and servers composed of parts that we release as open source so that others can build from the same foundations.\n\n\n### Standards\n\nStandards make modern software possible by connecting modular parts into systems. Open formats are the groundwork of open data. Mapbox is built on open standards: we adopt existing specs like GeoJSON and author new standards for new purposes, like [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec) and [GL Style Spec](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-style-spec). We release them under [permissive licenses](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) that enable everyone to freely implement them in products and software, and to improve upon them.\n\n### Design\n\nDesign components that are **reusable, general purpose, and not explicitly tied to the Mapbox brand**, like [Maki](https://www.mapbox.com/maki/), make sense as open source. We also release templates that show how to use our tools, like those in [Guides](https://www.mapbox.com/guides/).\n\nMost of our artwork is copyrighted and not placed under any open license. It’s tied to the Mapbox identity: reusing the Mapbox.com website style isn’t a use-case we want to support. The uniqueness and specificity of our style is important to how customers identify “oh, this is Mapbox”.\n\n### Data\n\nThe vast majority of Mapbox’s data is in the open. Large sources include [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [USGS](http://www.usgs.gov/), [Landsat](http://landsat.usgs.gov/), [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/), and [OpenAddresses](http://openaddresses.io/). We contribute to these sources, participate in their communities, and invest in tools that help improve them.\n\nWe also work extensively with proprietary sets of data that we buy: we legally can’t open these. Nor do we release heavily processed data. Processing data and delivering the final products has obvious and real costs: server infrastructure and bandwidth, as well as labor. Our ability to distill meaning out of raw material is a core part of our product.",

As such we had to invent a few wheels. Wheels we shared with the world. Most notably: node-mysql, node-formidable, and node-retry. These are modules that are now industry standards for dealing with MySQL, file uploads, and networked/unreliable systems. We also contributed to Node.js itself a lot.\n\nOur latest open source project is 'tus'. tus is our most ambitious open source project yet: its goal is to change how the world does file uploading. tus is an open standard for resumable file uploads that has been started by Transloadit, and collaborated on by employees at Google, Yahoo, the director of engineering at Vimeo, an author of HTTP/1.1, and the creator of ZeroMQ. We're writing implementations of this protocol for all popular languages, so that developers around the globe can have drop-in reliable uploads for their projects.\n\nStrongly rooted in the open source community, we try to give back in as many ways we can:\n\n - Open sourcing our juicy bits\n - Talking on conferences and sponsoring them\n - Giving away free tickets to conferences on Twitter every month\n - Sharing our tech in articles\n - Contributing back (cash & code) to the giants whose shoulders we're standing on, such as ImageMagick, Node.js, and tus.io.\n \nWorking for Transloadit means no deadlines, no shortcuts, working on open source for 80% of the time, being\nflexible with your hours, and getting really excited about new tech we push out.",

The team agreed he was the best choice, but were concerned about working with someone halfway around the globe.\n\nIn response, the two friends created a new web-based platform that brought visibility and trust to remote work. It was so successful the two realized other businesses would also benefit from reliable access to a larger pool of proven talent, while workers would enjoy freedom and flexibility to find jobs online. Together they decided to start a company that would deliver on the promise of this technology. Fast-forward to today, that technology is the foundation of Upwork — the leading flexible talent solution. With millions of jobs posted on Upwork annually, independent professionals are earning money by providing companies with over 5,000 skills across more than 70 categories of work.\n\nUpwork Pro is an exclusive group that gives the best freelance professionals access to clients and projects not accessible to the entire marketplace. Qualifying freelancers will receive an invitation to join the group.",
